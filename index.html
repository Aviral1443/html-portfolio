          <a><h2>About Me : </h2></a>
          <p>
            My name is Aviral Srivastava, and I am from Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh. I was a student of the 2022 batch of <span class="creative2"><a class="creative2" href="https://www.sjcallahabad.org/" >St. Joseph's College, Prayagraj.</a></span>
            I am a avid follower of various sports with a perticular interest in Racing and Cricket. I used to play lawn tennis to a competitive standard and I also dipped my toes in a little bit of Cricket.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for my Programming history, I started with the, now, ancient language Turtle when my school started it as a part of the syllabus in class 4 and 5 to get the students acclimatized
            with the concept of giving computer coded instructions and analysing the result as the output. 
          </p>

          <p>
            For the next few years I studied a little bits of a few different computer languages but nothing noteworthy enough to have a meaningful impact. I started on my main programming journey in 2019 when I was introduced to JAVA
            as a part of my course studies. Over the next 4 years I mastered and Re-mastered the entry and intermediate concepts of JAVA and have now become fluent in  the entry concepts of the language.            
          </p>

          <p>
            The current jounrey has me developing new skills and honing some old ones everyday to become the best in what I do.
